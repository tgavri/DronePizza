# DronePizza

DronePizza is an autonomous drone-based pizza delivery system that streamlines order management and delivery operations. The system allows users to assign drones to orders, track deliveries, and manage drone statuses effectively.
This is a project I made for my 3rd semester exam.

## Features
- Manage pizza delivery orders with expected delivery times.
- Assign drones to outstanding orders.
- Track drone statuses (active, out of order, or retired).
- User-friendly dashboard for managing deliveries and drones.
